Key:
- Fully solved: I solved the puzzle and used an intended solution from the beginning
- Initially cheesed: I brute forced the puzzle initially and wasn't supposed to, but figured it out the intended way afterwards
- Cheesed: I brute forced the puzzle, wasn't supposed to and didn't figure out the intended way
- Not solved: I didn't solve the puzzle at all yet, but I have an idea how and it's just too difficult to implement
- No idea: I didn't solve the puzzle yet and I have no idea how
- Haven't seen puzzle: I haven't even solved part 1 and thus haven't seen part 2
